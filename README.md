# autohotkeys
autohotkey files for when I have to use windows

I recommend creating an "AutoHotKey" folder in your Local Disk folder for saving these scripts.

To run ahk scripts on startup, follow these instructions:
1. In File Explorer, go to where the script is saved (C/AutoHotKey, for example)
2. Right click -> Send to -> Desktop
3. Go to Desktop folder and copy the shortcut
4. `Meta + R` to open Run. Enter: "shell:startup"
5. Paste the ahk script shortcut here
6. That's it, it will run on startup
